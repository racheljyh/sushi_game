# sushi_game
A catching falling objects game deeveloped using Python and PyCharm. 

Instructions:

Choose from three varying levels of difficulty and press 'Space' at anytime to return to the main menu. Move your basket by using the 'left' and 'right' arrow keys.
The objective of the game is to earn as many points as possible in 60 seconds by successfully collecting all the desired goods. 

Easy Mode: 
Each good you collect will add 100 points to your score and each wasabi you collect subtracts 100 points from your score (until a minimum of 0 points). 

Normal Mode: 
Each good you collect will add 100 points to your score and each wasabi you collect subtracts 200 points from your score (until a minimum of 0 points). 

Hard Mode: 
There is double the amount of wasabi (falling at a faster rate than easy and normal mode). Each good you collect will add 100 points to your score and each wasabi you collect subtracts 200 points from your score (until a minimum of 0 points).
